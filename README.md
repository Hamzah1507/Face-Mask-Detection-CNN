# Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project detects whether a person in an uploaded image is wearing a mask or not using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
It is built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV.

## 🚀 Features
- Detects "with Mask" or "Without Mask" from uploaded images.
- Works on any image with a face.
- High accuracy on test dataset.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset used: [Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset/data)  

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Face-Mask-Detection.git
   cd Face-Mask-Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```
   jupyter notebook face_mask_detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells and upload an image to check mask status.
