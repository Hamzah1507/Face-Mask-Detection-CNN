# Face-Mask-Detetction-CNN
Deep Learning-based Face Mask Detection  — A computer vision project that detects whether a person in an uploaded image is wearing a face mask or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV, the model analyzes the input image and classifies it into “Mask” or “No Mask” categories.
